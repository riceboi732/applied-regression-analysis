### Importing the data set
heartoriginal <- read.csv("~/Stat230/heart.csv")
```


###Uploading the dataset and removing incomplete cases.
```{r}
###Dropping N/A values that would interfere with teh dataset
heartoriginal <- heartoriginal %>% drop_na()
heart <- filter(heartoriginal, Cholesterol > 0)
```

###Fitting the full model with all the predictors on the entire Dataset.
```{r}
### Creating the full glm model for the dataset with all variables
heart_glm <- glm(HeartDisease ~ Age + Sex + ChestPainType + RestingBP + Cholesterol + FastingBS + RestingECG + MaxHR + ExerciseAngina + Oldpeak + ST_Slope, family = binomial, data=heart)
summary(heart_glm)
```

###Augmenting code for easier viewing experience
crp(heart_glm)
heart_aug <- augment(heart_glm)
heart_aug %>%
 slice_max(.hat, n = 1)
plot(heart_glm, which=4, id.n = 4)
plot(heart_glm, which=5, id.n = 4)

### Finding the dimensions for our dataset
dim(heart)
heart <- mutate(heart, Age_grps = ntile(Age, n = 20))
table(heart$Age_grps)
```

### Finding important values for our dataset (median, proportion, and log odds)
heart_empLO <-heart %>%
  group_by(Age_grps) %>%
   summarize(Age_grps_med = median(Age),    # median Age of groups
             pi_emp = mean(HeartDisease),         # proportion died
